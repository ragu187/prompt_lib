# Concept Explainer

## Category
Learning

## Description
Get clear, comprehensive explanations of complex concepts with examples, analogies, and different perspectives.

## Prompt

```
Please explain the following concept:

**Concept:**
[CONCEPT_NAME]

**My Current Understanding:**
[WHAT_YOU_ALREADY_KNOW]

**What I Want to Learn:**
[SPECIFIC_QUESTIONS]

**My Background:**
[YOUR_LEVEL] (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert in related field)

Please provide:
1. **Simple Definition**: Explain it in simple terms
2. **Detailed Explanation**: More comprehensive breakdown
3. **Real-World Examples**: Practical examples or use cases
4. **Analogies**: Compare it to something familiar
5. **Common Misconceptions**: What people often get wrong
6. **Related Concepts**: How it connects to other ideas
7. **Learning Resources**: Where to learn more

Explain at a level appropriate for: [TARGET_LEVEL]
```

## Variables

- `[CONCEPT_NAME]`: The concept you want explained
- `[WHAT_YOU_ALREADY_KNOW]`: Your current understanding
- `[SPECIFIC_QUESTIONS]`: Particular aspects you're confused about
- `[YOUR_LEVEL]`: Your current knowledge level
- `[TARGET_LEVEL]`: The depth of explanation you need

## Example Usage

### Input
```
Please explain the following concept:

**Concept:**
Machine Learning Neural Networks

**My Current Understanding:**
I know they're used in AI and involve layers, but I don't understand how they actually work.

**What I Want to Learn:**
How do neural networks learn? What are layers? How is this different from regular programming?

**My Background:**
Software developer with 5 years experience, but no AI/ML background

Please provide:
1. **Simple Definition**: Explain it in simple terms
2. **Detailed Explanation**: More comprehensive breakdown
3. **Real-World Examples**: Practical examples or use cases
4. **Analogies**: Compare it to something familiar
5. **Common Misconceptions**: What people often get wrong
6. **Related Concepts**: How it connects to other ideas
7. **Learning Resources**: Where to learn more

Explain at a level appropriate for: intermediate technical audience
```

### Expected Output
A layered explanation starting with simple analogies (like how neurons in brain work), progressing to technical details about weights, activation functions, and training, with code examples.

## Tips

- Be honest about your current understanding
- Ask specific questions about confusing parts
- Mention your background to get appropriate depth
- Request examples from domains you're familiar with
- Ask for visualizations or diagrams if helpful
- Can be used for technical, scientific, philosophical, or any complex topics
